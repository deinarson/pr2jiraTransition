# Warning
This code does not work, or at least at the time it was written `Azure` was broken and their user support was arguably not fit for purpose.  Azure is dead to me because of this awful experience.


## What?
First I debugged for a couple days, copied official examples and never got any of these things to work. When I told azure support that I want to to understand why the official docs did not work.  I requested they take official doc that I was using and make it work.  The support agent got back to me with screen shots of how he did it using the web interface...

Then I repeated, "I need to launch more then 100 of them. are you going to do that for me?" the examples I gave were scripts not hot to do it via the web.

# Problem with azure support?
When you are scripting something that doesn't work, the support person should help you solve your issue, not show you how to do something else.


# Epilogue

In this case after rewriting the code in several languages and trying several different services in azure this never worked.

I hope Azure has improved, but at the time the sale people were selling us on how great it was and that everything worked...

I moved to AWS and finished the work in 5 minutes, with hundreds of deployed projects like this one.

Sales people can really suck, especially if they tell you things work when even their support could not make them work...  I have other things to do, I don't want to have to speak with support nor do I want to  support-support, they should already know how to do their job, that is why we have tiers of support... Isn't it?
